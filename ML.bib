  abstract = {Molecular polar surface area (PSA), i.e., surface belonging to polar atoms, is a descriptor that was shown to correlate well with passive molecular transport through membranes and, therefore, allows prediction of transport properties of drugs. The calculation of PSA, however, is rather time-consuming because of the necessity to generate a reasonable 3D molecular geometry and the calculation of the surface itself. A new approach for the calculation of the PSA is presented here, based on the summation of tabulated surface contributions of polar fragments. The method, termed topological PSA (TPSA), provides results which are practically identical with the 3D PSA (the correlation coefficient between 3D PSA and fragment-based TPSA for 34\,810 molecules from the World Drug Index is 0.99), while the computation speed is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster. The new methodology may, therefore, be used for fast bioavailability screening of virtual libraries having millions of molecules. This article describes the new methodology and shows the results of validation studies based on sets of published absorption data, including intestinal absorption, Caco-2 monolayer penetration, and blood-brain barrier penetration.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has become a powerful and frequently employed tool for the prediction of molecular properties, thus creating a need for open-source and versatile software solutions that can be operated by nonexperts. Among the current approaches, directed message-passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) have proven to perform well on a variety of property prediction tasks. The software package Chemprop implements the D-MPNN architecture and offers simple, easy, and fast access to machine-learned molecular properties. Compared to its initial version, we present a multitude of new Chemprop functionalities such as the support of multimolecule properties, reactions, atom/bond-level properties, and spectra. Further, we incorporate various uncertainty quantification and calibration methods along with related metrics as well as pretraining and transfer learning workflows, improved hyperparameter optimization, and other customization options concerning loss functions or atom/bond features. We benchmark D-MPNN models trained using Chemprop with the new reaction, atom-level, and spectra functionality on a variety of property prediction data sets, including MoleculeNet and SAMPL, and observe state-of-the-art performance on the prediction of water-octanol partition coefficients, reaction barrier heights, atomic partial charges, and absorption spectra. Chemprop enables out-of-the-box training of D-MPNN models for a variety of problem settings in fast, user-friendly, and open-source software.},

The descriptors are applied to the construction of QSAR/QSPR models for boiling point, vapor pressure, free energy of solvation in water, solubility in water, thrombin/trypsin/factor Xa activity, blood-brain barrier permeability, and compound classification. The wide applicability of these descriptors suggests uses in QSAR/QSPR, combinatorial library design, and molecular diversity work.},

  abstract = {Extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are a novel class of topological fingerprints for molecular characterization. Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs were developed specifically for structure-activity modeling. ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.},
