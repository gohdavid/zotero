  abstract = {Molecular polar surface area (PSA), i.e., surface belonging to polar atoms, is a descriptor that was shown to correlate well with passive molecular transport through membranes and, therefore, allows prediction of transport properties of drugs. The calculation of PSA, however, is rather time-consuming because of the necessity to generate a reasonable 3D molecular geometry and the calculation of the surface itself. A new approach for the calculation of the PSA is presented here, based on the summation of tabulated surface contributions of polar fragments. The method, termed topological PSA (TPSA), provides results which are practically identical with the 3D PSA (the correlation coefficient between 3D PSA and fragment-based TPSA for 34\,810 molecules from the World Drug Index is 0.99), while the computation speed is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster. The new methodology may, therefore, be used for fast bioavailability screening of virtual libraries having millions of molecules. This article describes the new methodology and shows the results of validation studies based on sets of published absorption data, including intestinal absorption, Caco-2 monolayer penetration, and blood-brain barrier penetration.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has become a powerful and frequently employed tool for the prediction of molecular properties, thus creating a need for open-source and versatile software solutions that can be operated by nonexperts. Among the current approaches, directed message-passing neural networks (D-MPNNs) have proven to perform well on a variety of property prediction tasks. The software package Chemprop implements the D-MPNN architecture and offers simple, easy, and fast access to machine-learned molecular properties. Compared to its initial version, we present a multitude of new Chemprop functionalities such as the support of multimolecule properties, reactions, atom/bond-level properties, and spectra. Further, we incorporate various uncertainty quantification and calibration methods along with related metrics as well as pretraining and transfer learning workflows, improved hyperparameter optimization, and other customization options concerning loss functions or atom/bond features. We benchmark D-MPNN models trained using Chemprop with the new reaction, atom-level, and spectra functionality on a variety of property prediction data sets, including MoleculeNet and SAMPL, and observe state-of-the-art performance on the prediction of water-octanol partition coefficients, reaction barrier heights, atomic partial charges, and absorption spectra. Chemprop enables out-of-the-box training of D-MPNN models for a variety of problem settings in fast, user-friendly, and open-source software.},

  abstract = {Prediction of aqueous solubilities or hydration free energies is an extensively studied area in machine learning applications in chemistry since water is the sole solvent in the living system. However, for non-aqueous solutions, few machine learning studies have been undertaken so far despite the fact that the solvation mechanism plays an important role in various chemical reactions. Here, we introduce Delfos (deep learning model for solvation free energies in generic organic solvents), which is a novel, machine-learning-based QSPR method which predicts solvation free energies for various organic solute and solvent systems. A novelty of Delfos involves two separate solvent and solute encoder networks that can quantify structural features of given compounds via word embedding and recurrent layers, augmented with the attention mechanism which extracts important substructures from outputs of recurrent neural networks. As a result, the predictor network calculates the solvation free energy of a given solvent--solute pair using features from encoders. With the results obtained from extensive calculations using 2495 solute--solvent pairs, we demonstrate that Delfos not only has great potential in showing accuracy comparable to that of the state-of-the-art computational chemistry methods, but also offers information about which substructures play a dominant role in the solvation process.},

Recent results indicate that increasing ring counts have detrimental effects on developability in the order carboaromatics{$\gg$}heteroaromatics{$>$}carboaliphatics{$>$}heteroaliphatics, with heteroaliphatics exerting a beneficial effect in many cases. Increasing aromatic ring count exerts effects on several developability parameters that are lipophilicity- and size-independent, and fused aromatic systems have a beneficial effect relative to their nonfused counterparts. Increasing aromatic ring count has a detrimental effect on human bioavailability parameters, and heteroaromatic ring count (but not other ring counts) has increased over time in marketed oral drugs.}

Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs were developed specifically for structure-activity modeling. ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.},

  abstract = {Advancements in neural machinery have led to a wide range of algorithmic solutions for molecular property prediction. Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial data sets spanning a wide variety of chemical end points. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary data sets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.},
