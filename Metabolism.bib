  abstract = {The detailed characterization and quantification of the kinetics of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by normal pancreatic islets is of considerable interest for characterizing {$\beta$}-cell dysfunction, assessing the quality of isolated islets, and improving the design of artificial pancreas devices. Here, we performed dynamic evaluation of GSIS by human and mouse islets at high temporal resolution (every minute) in response to different glucose steps using an automated multichannel perifusion instrument. In both species, insulin responses were biphasic (a transient first-phase peak followed by a sustained second-phase), and the amount of insulin released showed a sigmoid-type dependence on glucose concentration. However, compared to murine islets, human islets have (1) a less pronounced first-phase response, (2) a flat secretion rate during second-phase response, (3) a left-shifted concentration response (reaching half-maximal response at 7.9 {\textpm} 0.4 vs. 13.7 {\textpm} 0.6 mM), and (4) an {$\sim$}3-fold lower maximal secretion rate (8.3 {\textpm} 2.3 vs. 23.9 {\textpm} 5.1 pg/min/islet at 30 mM glucose). These results can be used to establish a more informative protocol for the calculation of the stimulation index, which is widely used for islet assessment in both research and clinical applications, but without an accepted standard or clear evidence as to what low- to high-glucose steps can provide better characterization of islet function. Data obtained here suggest that human islet functionality might be best characterized with a dynamic stimulation index obtained with a glucose step from a low of 4--5 to a high of 14--17 mM (e.g., G4 {$\rightarrow$} G16).},

  abstract = {Why do we get certain diseases, whereas other diseases do not exist? In this book, Alon, one of the founders of systems biology, builds a foundation for systems medicine. Starting from basic laws, the book derives why physiological circuits are built the way they are. The circuits have fragilities that explain specific diseases and offer new strategies to treat them. By the end, the reader will be able to use simple and powerful mathematical models to describe physiological circuits. The book explores, in three parts, hormone circuits, immune circuits, and aging and age-related disease. It culminates in a periodic table of diseases. Alon writes in a style accessible to a broad range of readers - undergraduates, graduates, or researchers from computational or biological backgrounds. The level of math is friendly and the math can even be bypassed altogether. For instructors and readers who want to go deeper, the book includes dozens of exercises that have been rigorously tested in the classroom},

The mechanism behind the movement of GLUT4 to surface membranes and the subsequent increase in transport by muscle contractions is largely unresolved, but it is likely to occur through intracellular signaling involving Ca               2+               -calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, 5{$\prime$}-AMP-activated protein kinase, and possibly protein kinase C.},
