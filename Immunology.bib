  abstract = {Over the past 50 years in the field of immunology, something of a Copernican revolution has happened. For a long time, immunologists were mainly concerned with what is termed adaptive immunity, which involves the exquisitely specific activities of lymphocytes. But the other arm of immunity, so-called ``innate immunity,'' had been neglected. To celebrate Cell's 50th anniversary, we have put together a review of the processes and components of innate immunity and trace the seminal contributions leading to the modern state of this field. Innate immunity has joined adaptive immunity in the center of interest for all those who study the body's defenses, as well as homeostasis and pathology. We are now entering the era where therapeutic targeting of innate immune receptors and downstream signals hold substantial promise for infectious and inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

  abstract = {Adaptive immunity provides protection against infectious and malignant diseases. These effects are mediated by lymphocytes that sense and respond with targeted precision to perturbations induced by pathogens and tissue damage. Here, we review key principles underlying adaptive immunity orchestrated by distinct T cell and B cell populations and their extensions to disease therapies. We discuss the intracellular and intercellular processes shaping antigen specificity and recognition in immune activation and lymphocyte functions in mediating effector and memory responses. We also describe how lymphocytes balance protective immunity against autoimmunity and immunopathology, including during immune tolerance, response to chronic antigen stimulation, and adaptation to non-lymphoid tissues in coordinating tissue immunity and homeostasis. Finally, we discuss extracellular signals and cell-intrinsic programs underpinning adaptive immunity and conclude by summarizing key advances in vaccination and engineering adaptive immune responses for therapeutic interventions. A deeper understanding of these principles holds promise for uncovering new means to improve human health.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Immunometabolism, which is the metabolic reprogramming of anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite synthesis upon immune cell activation, has gained importance as a regulator of the homeostasis, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets that function as key factors in immunity. Metabolic changes in epithelial and other stromal cells in response to different stimulatory signals are also crucial in infection, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. The crosstalk between the PI3K--AKT--mTOR and LKB1--AMPK signaling pathways is critical for modulating both immune and nonimmune cell metabolism. The bidirectional interaction between immune cells and metabolism is a topic of intense study. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokine receptors, and T and B cell receptors have been shown to activate multiple downstream metabolic pathways. However, how intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors intersect with metabolic pathways is less well understood. The goal of this review is to examine the link between immunometabolism and the functions of several intracellular innate immune sensors or receptors, such as nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs, or NOD-like receptors), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs), and the cyclic dinucleotide receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We will focus on recent advances and describe the impact of these intracellular innate immune receptors on multiple metabolic pathways. Whenever appropriate, this review will provide a brief contextual connection to pathogenic infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, metabolic disorders, and/or inflammatory bowel diseases.},

  abstract = {Host defenses against pathogens are energetically expensive, leading ecological immunologists to postulate that they might participate in energetic trade-offs with other maintenance programs. However, the metabolic costs of immunity and the nature of physiologic trade-offs it engages are largely unknown. We report here that activation of immunity causes an energetic trade-off with the homeothermy (the stable maintenance of core temperature), resulting in hypometabolism and hypothermia. This immunity-induced physiologic trade-off was independent of sickness behaviors but required hematopoietic sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Metabolomics and genome-wide expression profiling revealed that distinct metabolic programs supported entry and recovery from the energy-conserving hypometabolic state. During bacterial infections, hypometabolic states, which could be elicited by competition for energy between maintenance programs or energy restriction, promoted disease tolerance. Together, our findings suggest that energy-conserving hypometabolic states, such as dormancy, might have evolved as a mechanism of tissue tolerance.},

Glycans are one of the four fundamental macromolecular components of all cells, and are highly regulated in the immune system. Their diversity reflects their multiple biological functions that encompass ligands for proteinaceous receptors known as lectins. Since the discovery that selectins and their glycan ligands are important for the regulation of leukocyte trafficking, it has been shown that additional features of the vertebrate immune system are also controlled by endogenous cellular glycosylation. This Review focuses on the emerging immunological roles of the mammalian glycome.},

Thus, we still do not know how to design vaccines that would provide long-lasting protective immunity against certain pathogens, why autoimmune responses target some antigens and not others, or why the immune response to infection sometimes does more harm than good. Understanding some of these mysteries may require that we question existing assumptions to develop and test alternative explanations.

These sequelae can also be found in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases that are in remission and in ageing individuals, despite the immune system being less active in these situations. This Perspectives article proposes a new way of understanding situations of chronic inflammation (such as rheumatic diseases) and ageing based on the principles of evolutionary medicine, energy regulation and neuroendocrine--immune crosstalk. A conceptual framework is provided to enable physicians and scientists to better understand the signs and symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases and long-term disease consequences resulting from physical and mental inactivity.},

These antigens were compared with mosaic-8b, which elicits cross-reactive antibodies and protects from sarbecovirus challenges in animals. Immunizations in na{\"i}ve and COVID-19 pre-vaccinated mice revealed that mosaic-7             COM             elicited higher binding and neutralization titers than mosaic-8b and related antigens. Deep mutational scanning showed that mosaic-7             COM             targeted conserved RBD epitopes. Mosaic-2             COM             s and mosaic-5             COM             elicited higher titers than homotypic SARS-CoV-2 Beta RBD-nanoparticles and increased potencies against some SARS-CoV-2 variants than mosaic-7             COM             . However, mosaic-7             COM             elicited more potent responses against zoonotic sarbecoviruses and highly mutated Omicrons.
