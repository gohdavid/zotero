            Using computational methods, we designed 60-mer nanoparticles displaying SARS-like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) receptor-binding domains (RBDs) by (
            i
            ) creating RBD sequences with 6 mutations in the SARS-COV-2 WA1 RBD that were predicted to retain proper folding and abrogate antibody responses to variable epitopes (mosaic-2
            COM
            s; mosaic-5
            COM
            ), and (
            ii
            ) selecting 7 natural sarbecovirus RBDs (mosaic-7
            COM
            ). These antigens were compared with mosaic-8b, which elicits cross-reactive antibodies and protects from sarbecovirus challenges in animals. Immunizations in naïve and COVID-19 pre-vaccinated mice revealed that mosaic-7
            COM
            elicited higher binding and neutralization titers than mosaic-8b and related antigens. Deep mutational scanning showed that mosaic-7
            COM
            targeted conserved RBD epitopes. Mosaic-2
            COM
            s and mosaic-5
            COM
            elicited higher titers than homotypic SARS-CoV-2 Beta RBD-nanoparticles and increased potencies against some SARS-CoV-2 variants than mosaic-7
            COM
            . However, mosaic-7
            COM
            elicited more potent responses against zoonotic sarbecoviruses and highly mutated Omicrons. These results support using mosaic-7
            COM
            to protect against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic sarbecoviruses with spillover potential.},

However, the metabolic costs of immunity and the nature of physiologic trade-offs it engages are largely unknown. We report here that activation of immunity causes an energetic trade-off with the homeothermy (the stable maintenance of core temperature), resulting in hypometabolism and hypothermia. This immunity-induced physiologic trade-off was independent of sickness behaviors but required hematopoietic sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Metabolomics and genome-wide expression proﬁling revealed that distinct metabolic programs supported entry and recovery from the energy-conserving hypometabolic state. During bacterial infections, hypometabolic states, which could be elicited by competition for energy between maintenance programs or energy restriction, promoted disease tolerance. Together, our ﬁndings suggest that energy-conserving hypometabolic states, such as dormancy, might have evolved as a mechanism of tissue tolerance.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Immunometabolism, which is the metabolic reprogramming of anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite synthesis upon immune cell activation, has gained importance as a regulator of the homeostasis, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets that function as key factors in immunity. Metabolic changes in epithelial and other stromal cells in response to different stimulatory signals are also crucial in infection, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. The crosstalk between the PI3K–AKT–mTOR and LKB1–AMPK signaling pathways is critical for modulating both immune and nonimmune cell metabolism. The bidirectional interaction between immune cells and metabolism is a topic of intense study. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokine receptors, and T and B cell receptors have been shown to activate multiple downstream metabolic pathways. However, how intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors intersect with metabolic pathways is less well understood. The goal of this review is to examine the link between immunometabolism and the functions of several intracellular innate immune sensors or receptors, such as nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs, or NOD-like receptors), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs), and the cyclic dinucleotide receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We will focus on recent advances and describe the impact of these intracellular innate immune receptors on multiple metabolic pathways. Whenever appropriate, this review will provide a brief contextual connection to pathogenic infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, metabolic disorders, and/or inflammatory bowel diseases.},

	abstract = {The detailed characterization and quantiﬁcation of the kinetics of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by normal pancreatic islets is of considerable interest for characterizing β-cell dysfunction, assessing the quality of isolated islets, and improving the design of artiﬁcial pancreas devices. Here, we performed dynamic evaluation of GSIS by human and mouse islets at high temporal resolution (every minute) in response to different glucose steps using an automated multichannel perifusion instrument. In both species, insulin responses were biphasic (a transient ﬁrst-phase peak followed by a sustained second-phase), and the amount of insulin released showed a sigmoid-type dependence on glucose concentration. However, compared to murine islets, human islets have (1) a less pronounced ﬁrst-phase response, (2) a ﬂat secretion rate during second-phase response, (3) a left-shifted concentration response (reaching half-maximal response at 7.9 ± 0.4 vs. 13.7 ± 0.6 mM), and (4) an ∼3-fold lower maximal secretion rate (8.3 ± 2.3 vs. 23.9 ± 5.1 pg/min/islet at 30 mM glucose). These results can be used to establish a more informative protocol for the calculation of the stimulation index, which is widely used for islet assessment in both research and clinical applications, but without an accepted standard or clear evidence as to what low- to high-glucose steps can provide better characterization of islet function. Data obtained here suggest that human islet functionality might be best characterized with a dynamic stimulation index obtained with a glucose step from a low of 4–5 to a high of 14–17 mM (e.g., G4 → G16).},

In this book, Alon, one of the founders of systems biology, builds a foundation for systems medicine.
Starting from basic laws, the book derives why physiological circuits are built the way they are. The circuits have fragilities that explain specific diseases and offer new strategies to treat them.
By the end, the reader will be able to use simple and powerful mathematical models to describe physiological circuits. The book explores, in three parts, hormone circuits, immune circuits, and aging and age-related disease. It culminates in a periodic table of diseases.
Alon writes in a style accessible to a broad range of readers - undergraduates, graduates, or researchers from computational or biological backgrounds. The level of math is friendly and the math can even be bypassed altogether. For instructors and readers who want to go deeper, the book includes dozens of exercises that have been rigorously tested in the classroom},

              H NMR data with a reversible, non-steady-state Michaelis-Menten model. Dynamic data were obtained by measuring brain and plasma glucose time courses during glucose infusions to raise and maintain plasma concentration at ∼17 mmol/l for ∼2 h in five healthy volunteers. Steady-state brain vs. plasma glucose concentrations were taken from literature and the steady-state portions of data from the five volunteers. In addition to providing simultaneous measurements of glucose transport and utilization and obviating assumptions for constant CMR
              glc
              , this methodology does not necessitate infusions of expensive or radioactive tracers. Using this new methodology, we found that the maximum transport capacity for glucose through the blood-brain barrier was nearly twofold higher than maximum cerebral glucose utilization. The glucose transport and utilization parameters were consistent with previously published values for human brain.},

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are considered as the main component in the tumor microenvironment and play an important role in tumor initiation, growth, invasion, and metastasis. Recently, metabolic studies have revealeded specific metabolic pathways in macrophages are tightly associated with their phenotype and function. Generally, pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) rely mainly on glycolysis and exhibit impairment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) are more dependent on mitochondrial OXPHOS. However, accumulating evidence suggests that macrophage metabolism is not as simple as previously thought. This review discusses recent advances in immunometabolism and describes how metabolism determines macrophage phenotype and function. In addition, we describe the metabolic characteristics of TAMs as well as their therapeutic implications. Finally, we discuss recent obstacles facing this area as well as promising directions for future study.},

Distinct T cell subsets, however, adopt metabolic programs specific to support their needs. As CD4 T cells coordinate adaptive immune responses while CD8 T cells become cytotoxic effectors, we compared activation-induced proliferation and metabolic reprogramming of these subsets. Resting CD4 and CD8 T cells were metabolically similar and used a predominantly oxidative metabolism. Following activation CD8 T cells proliferated more rapidly. Stimulation led both CD4 and CD8 T cells to sharply increase glucose metabolism and adopt aerobic glycolysis as a primary metabolic program. Activated CD4 T cells, however, remained more oxidative and had greater maximal respiratory capacity than activated CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells were also associated with greater levels of ROS and increased mitochondrial content, irrespective of the activation context. CD8 cells were better able, however, to oxidize glutamine as an alternative fuel source. The more glycolytic metabolism of activated CD8 T cells correlated with increased capacity for growth and proliferation, along with reduced sensitivity of cell growth to metabolic inhibition. These specific metabolic programs may promote greater growth and proliferation of CD8 T cells and enhance survival in diverse nutrient conditions.},

Isotopomer tracing uncovered increases in TCA cycle intermediates with almost no contribution from glucose. Instead, glucose mainly supported the biosynthesis of ribonucleotides. Glucose restriction did not affect B cell functions, yet the inhibition of OXPHOS or glutamine restriction markedly impaired B cell growth and differentiation. Increased OXPHOS prompted studies of mitochondrial dynamics, which revealed extensive mitochondria remodeling during activation. Our results show how B cell metabolism adapts with stimulation and reveals unexpected details for carbon utilization and mitochondrial dynamics at the start of a humoral immune response.},

	abstract = {Assays to monitor the metabolic state or nutrient uptake capacity of immune cells at a single cell level are increasingly in demand. One assay, used by many immunologists, employs 2-(N-(7Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescent analogue of 2deoxyglucose (2DG), as a substrate for glucose transporters. This molecule has been validated as a substrate for the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) in mammalian cells but 2-NDBG selectivity for the glucose transporters expressed by T cells, Glut1 (Slc2a1) and Glut3 (Slc2a3), has never been explored. Nor has the possibility that 2-NBDG might bind to T cells that do not express glucose transporters been assessed. In this technical commentary we interrogate the specificity of 2-NBBG labelling as a readout for glucose transport in T lymphocytes. We compare flow cytometric 2-NBDG staining against well validated radiolabelled glucose transport assays in murine T cells. Our data show there can be a large discordance between glucose transport capacity and 2-NBDG labelling in T cells. We also find that 2-NBDG uptake into murine T cells is not inhibited by competitive substrates or facilitative glucose transporter inhibitors, nor can 2-NBDG competitively block glucose uptake in T cells. Collectively, these data argue that 2-NBDG uptake alone is not a reliable tool for the assessment of cellular glucose transport capacity.},

	abstract = {"Extended priming" immunization regimens that prolong exposure of the immune system to vaccines during the primary immune response have shown promise in enhancing humoral immune responses to a variety of subunit vaccines in preclinical models. We previously showed that escalating-dosing immunization (EDI), where a vaccine is dosed every other day in an increasing pattern over 2 weeks dramatically amplifies humoral immune responses. But such a dosing regimen is impractical for prophylactic vaccines. We hypothesized that simpler dosing regimens might replicate key elements of the immune response triggered by EDI. Here we explored "reduced ED" immunization regimens, assessing the impact of varying the number of injections, dose levels, and dosing intervals during EDI. Using a stabilized HIV Env trimer as a model antigen combined with a potent saponin adjuvant, we found that a two-shot extended-prime regimen consisting of immunization with 20\% of a given vaccine dose followed by a second shot with the remaining 80\% of the dose 7 days later resulted in increased total GC B cells, 5-10-fold increased frequencies of antigen-specific GC B cells, and 10-fold increases in serum antibody titers compared to single bolus immunization. Computational modeling of the GC response suggested that this enhanced response is mediated by antigen delivered in the second dose being captured more efficiently as immune complexes in follicles, predictions we verified experimentally. Our computational and experimental results also highlight how properly designed reduced ED protocols enhance activation and antigen loading of dendritic cells and activation of T helper cells to amplify humoral responses. These results suggest that a two-shot priming approach can be used to substantially enhance responses to subunit vaccines.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is associated with obesity, ageing and inactivity. It is due to a progressive failure of pancreatic islet β-cells to compensate for insulin resistance.The proposed mechanisms to explain impaired insulin secretion and sensitivity in type 2 diabetes include oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, amyloid deposition in the pancreas, ectopic lipid deposition in muscle, liver and pancreas, and lipotoxicity and glucotoxicity. All these cellular stresses may induce an inflammatory response or are exacerbated by or associated with inflammation.Factors that are associated with innate immune responses are present in the circulation, insulin-sensitive tissues and pancreatic islets in type 2 diabetes, and this evidence supports the involvement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of this disease.Mechanisms thought to be responsible for the inflammatory state in type 2 diabetes include hypoxia and cell death of expanding adipose tissue, activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, activation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and recruitment and activation of immune cells.Clinical trials using IL-1 antagonists or salsalate to directly target pro-inflammatory factors in patients with type 2 diabetes show promising preliminary results and support the role of inflammation in this condition.Existing data suggest a potential role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The relative importance of this mechanism and the precise therapeutic consequences remain to be elucidated.},

In a 12-month prospective cohort study conducted as part of the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, we compared 705 adult patients who had DM1 and 6712 adult patients who had DM2 with 18,911 control patients who had hypertension without diabetes. Outcome measures were medically attended episodes of infection of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, and skin and mucous membranes. We applied multivariable and polytomous logistic regression analysis to determine independent risks of infections and their recurrences in patients with diabetes, compared with control patients.Results. Upper respiratory infections were equally common among patients with diabetes and control patients. Patients with diabetes had a greater risk of lower respiratory tract infection (for patients with DM1: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.42 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 0.96–2.08]; for patients with DM2: AOR, 1.32 [95\% CI, 1.13–1.53]), urinary tract infection (for patients with DM1: AOR, 1.96 [95\% CI, 1.49–2.58]; for patients with DM2: AOR, 1.24 [95\% CI, 1.10–1.39]), bacterial skin and mucous membrane infection (for patients with DM1: AOR, 1.59 [95\% CI, 1.12–2.24]; for patients with DM2: AOR, 1.33 [95\% CI, 1.15–1.54]), and mycotic skin and mucous membrane infection (for patients with DM1: AOR, 1.34 [95\% CI, 0.97–1.84]; for patients with DM2: AOR, 1.44 [95\% CI, 1.27–1.63]). Risks increased with recurrences of common infections.Conclusions. Patients with DM1 and DM2 are at increased risk for lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and skin and mucous membrane infection. Studies are warranted into management of such infections in patients with diabetes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem worldwide. This metabolic disease is indicated by high blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin production by the pancreas. An inflammatory response occurs as a result of the immune response to high blood glucose levels as well as the presence of inflammatory mediators produced by adipocytes and macrophages in fat tissue. This low and chronic inflammation damages the pancreatic beta cells and leads to insufficient insulin production, which results in hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia in diabetes is thought to cause dysfunction of the immune response, which fails to control the spread of invading pathogens in diabetic subjects. Therefore, diabetic subjects are known to more susceptible to infections. The increased prevalence of T2D will increase the incidence of infectious diseases and related comorbidities.
OBJECTIVE: This review provides an overview of the immunological aspect of T2D and the possible mechanisms that result in increased infections in diabetics.
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of how immune dysfunctions occur during hyperglycemia can lead to novel treatments and preventions for infectious diseases and T2D comorbidities, thus improving the outcome of infectious disease treatment in T2D patients.},

	abstract = {While modernization has dramatically increased lifespan, it has also witnessed the increasing prevalence of diseases such as obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Such chronic, acquired diseases result when normal physiologic control goes awry and may thus be viewed as failures of homeostasis. However, while nearly every process in human physiology relies on homeostatic mechanisms for stability, only some have demonstrated vulnerability to dysregulation. Additionally, chronic inflammation is a common accomplice of the diseases of homeostasis, yet the basis for this connection is not fully understood. Here we review the design of homeostatic systems and discuss universal features of control circuits that operate at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels. We suggest a framework for classification of homeostatic signals that is based on different classes of homeostatic variables they report on. Finally, we discuss how adaptability of homeostatic systems with adjustable set points creates vulnerability to dysregulation and disease. This framework highlights the fundamental parallels between homeostatic and inflammatory control mechanisms and provides a new perspective on the physiological origin of inflammation.},
