  abstract = {The detailed characterization and quantification of the kinetics of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) by normal pancreatic islets is of considerable interest for characterizing {$\beta$}-cell dysfunction, assessing the quality of isolated islets, and improving the design of artificial pancreas devices. Here, we performed dynamic evaluation of GSIS by human and mouse islets at high temporal resolution (every minute) in response to different glucose steps using an automated multichannel perifusion instrument. In both species, insulin responses were biphasic (a transient first-phase peak followed by a sustained second-phase), and the amount of insulin released showed a sigmoid-type dependence on glucose concentration. However, compared to murine islets, human islets have (1) a less pronounced first-phase response, (2) a flat secretion rate during second-phase response, (3) a left-shifted concentration response (reaching half-maximal response at 7.9 {\textpm} 0.4 vs. 13.7 {\textpm} 0.6 mM), and (4) an {$\sim$}3-fold lower maximal secretion rate (8.3 {\textpm} 2.3 vs. 23.9 {\textpm} 5.1 pg/min/islet at 30 mM glucose). These results can be used to establish a more informative protocol for the calculation of the stimulation index, which is widely used for islet assessment in both research and clinical applications, but without an accepted standard or clear evidence as to what low- to high-glucose steps can provide better characterization of islet function. Data obtained here suggest that human islet functionality might be best characterized with a dynamic stimulation index obtained with a glucose step from a low of 4--5 to a high of 14--17 mM (e.g., G4 {$\rightarrow$} G16).},

Starting from basic laws, the book derives why physiological circuits are built the way they are. The circuits have fragilities that explain specific diseases and offer new strategies to treat them. By the end, the reader will be able to use simple and powerful mathematical models to describe physiological circuits. The book explores, in three parts, hormone circuits, immune circuits, and aging and age-related disease. It culminates in a periodic table of diseases. Alon writes in a style accessible to a broad range of readers - undergraduates, graduates, or researchers from computational or biological backgrounds. The level of math is friendly and the math can even be bypassed altogether. For instructors and readers who want to go deeper, the book includes dozens of exercises that have been rigorously tested in the classroom},

Distinct T cell subsets, however, adopt metabolic programs specific to support their needs. As CD4 T cells coordinate adaptive immune responses while CD8 T cells become cytotoxic effectors, we compared activation-induced proliferation and metabolic reprogramming of these subsets. Resting CD4 and CD8 T cells were metabolically similar and used a predominantly oxidative metabolism. Following activation CD8 T cells proliferated more rapidly. Stimulation led both CD4 and CD8 T cells to sharply increase glucose metabolism and adopt aerobic glycolysis as a primary metabolic program. Activated CD4 T cells, however, remained more oxidative and had greater maximal respiratory capacity than activated CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells were also associated with greater levels of ROS and increased mitochondrial content, irrespective of the activation context. CD8 cells were better able, however, to oxidize glutamine as an alternative fuel source. The more glycolytic metabolism of activated CD8 T cells correlated with increased capacity for growth and proliferation, along with reduced sensitivity of cell growth to metabolic inhibition. These specific metabolic programs may promote greater growth and proliferation of CD8 T cells and enhance survival in diverse nutrient conditions.},

For a long time, immunologists were mainly concerned with what is termed adaptive immunity, which involves the exquisitely specific activities of lymphocytes. But the other arm of immunity, so-called ``innate immunity,'' had been neglected. To celebrate Cell's 50th anniversary, we have put together a review of the processes and components of innate immunity and trace the seminal contributions leading to the modern state of this field. Innate immunity has joined adaptive immunity in the center of interest for all those who study the body's defenses, as well as homeostasis and pathology. We are now entering the era where therapeutic targeting of innate immune receptors and downstream signals hold substantial promise for infectious and inflammatory diseases and cancer.},

How metabolic plasticity and adaptation dictate functional specialization of immune cells is fundamental to our understanding and therapeutic modulation of the immune system. Immense progress has been made in characterizing the effects of metabolic networks on immune cell fate and function in discrete microenvironments or immunological contexts. In this review, we summarize how rewiring of cellular metabolism determines the outcome of adaptive immunity in vivo, with a focus on how metabolites, nutrients, and driver genes in immunometabolism instruct cellular programming and immune responses during infection, inflammation, and cancer in mice and humans.

Metabolic changes in epithelial and other stromal cells in response to different stimulatory signals are also crucial in infection, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. The crosstalk between the PI3K--AKT--mTOR and LKB1--AMPK signaling pathways is critical for modulating both immune and nonimmune cell metabolism. The bidirectional interaction between immune cells and metabolism is a topic of intense study. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokine receptors, and T and B cell receptors have been shown to activate multiple downstream metabolic pathways. However, how intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors intersect with metabolic pathways is less well understood. The goal of this review is to examine the link between immunometabolism and the functions of several intracellular innate immune sensors or receptors, such as nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs, or NOD-like receptors), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs), and the cyclic dinucleotide receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We will focus on recent advances and describe the impact of these intracellular innate immune receptors on multiple metabolic pathways. Whenever appropriate, this review will provide a brief contextual connection to pathogenic infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, metabolic disorders, and/or inflammatory bowel diseases.},

However, the metabolic costs of immunity and the nature of physiologic trade-offs it engages are largely unknown. We report here that activation of immunity causes an energetic trade-off with the homeothermy (the stable maintenance of core temperature), resulting in hypometabolism and hypothermia. This immunity-induced physiologic trade-off was independent of sickness behaviors but required hematopoietic sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Metabolomics and genome-wide expression profiling revealed that distinct metabolic programs supported entry and recovery from the energy-conserving hypometabolic state. During bacterial infections, hypometabolic states, which could be elicited by competition for energy between maintenance programs or energy restriction, promoted disease tolerance. Together, our findings suggest that energy-conserving hypometabolic states, such as dormancy, might have evolved as a mechanism of tissue tolerance.},

Recently, metabolic studies have revealeded specific metabolic pathways in macrophages are tightly associated with their phenotype and function. Generally, pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) rely mainly on glycolysis and exhibit impairment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) are more dependent on mitochondrial OXPHOS.

Extraction of the kinetic parameters for cerebral glucose transport necessitated assuming a constant cerebral metabolic rate of glucose ( CMR               glc               ) obtained from other tracer studies, such as               13               C NMR.

Steady-state brain vs. plasma glucose concentrations were taken from literature and the steady-state portions of data from the five volunteers. In addition to providing simultaneous measurements of glucose transport and utilization and obviating assumptions for constant CMR               glc               , this methodology does not necessitate infusions of expensive or radioactive tracers. Using this new methodology, we found that the maximum transport capacity for glucose through the blood-brain barrier was nearly twofold higher than maximum cerebral glucose utilization. The glucose transport and utilization parameters were consistent with previously published values for human brain.},

These sequelae can also be found in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases that are in remission and in ageing individuals, despite the immune system being less active in these situations. This Perspectives article proposes a new way of understanding situations of chronic inflammation (such as rheumatic diseases) and ageing based on the principles of evolutionary medicine, energy regulation and neuroendocrine--immune crosstalk. A conceptual framework is provided to enable physicians and scientists to better understand the signs and symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases and long-term disease consequences resulting from physical and mental inactivity.},

  abstract = {Summary                        Using computational methods, we designed 60-mer nanoparticles displaying SARS-like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) receptor-binding domains (RBDs) by (             i             ) creating RBD sequences with 6 mutations in the SARS-COV-2 WA1 RBD that were predicted to retain proper folding and abrogate antibody responses to variable epitopes (mosaic-2             COM             s; mosaic-5             COM             ), and (             ii             ) selecting 7 natural sarbecovirus RBDs (mosaic-7             COM             ). These antigens were compared with mosaic-8b, which elicits cross-reactive antibodies and protects from sarbecovirus challenges in animals. Immunizations in na{\"i}ve and COVID-19 pre-vaccinated mice revealed that mosaic-7             COM             elicited higher binding and neutralization titers than mosaic-8b and related antigens. Deep mutational scanning showed that mosaic-7             COM             targeted conserved RBD epitopes. Mosaic-2             COM             s and mosaic-5             COM             elicited higher titers than homotypic SARS-CoV-2 Beta RBD-nanoparticles and increased potencies against some SARS-CoV-2 variants than mosaic-7             COM             . However, mosaic-7             COM             elicited more potent responses against zoonotic sarbecoviruses and highly mutated Omicrons. These results support using mosaic-7             COM             to protect against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic sarbecoviruses with spillover potential.},

  abstract = {B lymphocytes provide adaptive immunity by generating antigen-specific antibodies and supporting the activation of T cells. Little is known about how global metabolism supports naive B cell activation to enable an effective immune response. By coupling RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data with glucose isotopomer tracing, we show that stimulated B cells increase programs for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and nucleotide biosynthesis, but not glycolysis. Isotopomer tracing uncovered increases in TCA cycle intermediates with almost no contribution from glucose. Instead, glucose mainly supported the biosynthesis of ribonucleotides. Glucose restriction did not affect B cell functions, yet the inhibition of OXPHOS or glutamine restriction markedly impaired B cell growth and differentiation. Increased OXPHOS prompted studies of mitochondrial dynamics, which revealed extensive mitochondria remodeling during activation. Our results show how B cell metabolism adapts with stimulation and reveals unexpected details for carbon utilization and mitochondrial dynamics at the start of a humoral immune response.},
